## Abstract: 
The proof of work consensus mechanism requires miners to present some piece of information that was extremely challenging to produce, and very fast to verify. PoW systems are often criticized for the fact that this “work” is not societally useful (beyond securing public financial infrastructure). 

It takes a significant amount of computational cost to train ML models, however anybody with the architecture and weights cn quickly verify its performance. Given this parallel, create a proof of work consensus mechanism that centers around model training/performance. 

## Project Motivation: 
If adopted, this would accelerate ML/AI technology, by incentivizing cross-disciplinary teams to design new and faster learning methods. I expect this mechanism to be ASIC resistant - even if not, everybody wins if this drives ASIC manufacturers to build chips that boost gradient descent learning by orders of magnitude. An iteration that includes a data marketplace would also peg the value of the token to the cost of cloud computing, imbuing a rare intrinsic value that sets a floor to prevent hypothesized miner death spirals.

## Fellow Motivation: 
This is a legitimate application of the “AI on the blockchain”, and will show a level of familiarity with protocol design. Iterations involving a data marketplace would probably demonstrate experienced with decentralized storage systems.
